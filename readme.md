## Installation

Clone this project and run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.

The project is composed of three subprojects for which the names should be self-explanatory. The source code for the subprojects is found in the "source" directory.

The subprojects are built using the `npm run build` command and the server is launched using the `node .` command. The server launches an HTTP server that serves the contents of the "dist/client" directory.
